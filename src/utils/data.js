        <li>Petrissage: Kneading, rolling, and lifting motions</li>
        <li>Friction: Circular movements, wringing, or small circles</li>
        <li>Tapotement: Percussive movements</li>

    description: `<div>4 hands massage is a massage where two therapists work on you at the same time, mirroring each others' movements. For example, both your legs or arms are being massaged at the same time. Or one therapist works on the right side of your back while the other works on the left.</div>
    <p><br>&nbsp;</p>
    <div>To synchronize, one therapist takes the lead and the other follows. It should feel like they are doing the same thing simultaneously. It helps if they have a similar style and touch and have worked together before.</div>
    <p><br>&nbsp;</p>
    <div>When done well, 4 hands massage feels like you are completely enveloped in sensation and can be quite a wonderful experience. It costs twice as much because you have two therapists, but if you're a spa junkie and like to try anything at least once, you should definitely try it.</div>

   description:`<p>Back pain can range from very minor muscle spasms caused by exercise to chronic and debilitating discomfort. Back pain happens to almost everyone at some point. In fact, when looking for information on massage, more people search for "back massage" than for shoulders, knees, hands, neck or any other part of the body.</p>

    <br><br>

    <p>A good back massage can help relieve lower back pain. After a strenuous workout or sitting at a desk all day, your back muscles are likely to be tense from overuse or repetitive use. When a massage therapist works those muscles, some of the tension is released.</p>

    <br><br>

    <p>Along with enhancing other types of medical treatment, back massage therapy can provide significant relief of incidental or chronic pain. Whether chronic pain is due to limited mobility of the vertebral, pelvic and rib joints or to compression of nerves through muscle spasm, disease or structural dysfunction, it helps to find a professional therapist who's experienced in back massage.</p>

    <br><br>

    <p>One of the best benefits of a back massage is that it feels good. Sometimes you just need to take a little time to relax and enjoy the pleasurable sensation of the human touch.</p>

   description:`<div>Anti-cellulite massages are designed specifically to target cellulite and help with the reduction and elimination of cellulite in the affected areas.</div>
    <p><br>&nbsp;</p>
    <div>Using a special massage technique, the bulging fat is massaged and the muscles are kneaded, so the bulging fat can be rolled away so that the physical cause of cellulite - bulging fat and stretched collagen strands - can be countered. As a starting point, massage therapists usually work on the hips, thighs, legs, and feet in order to activate those areas. As a result of this process, blood circulation and energy flow throughout the body are increased. The sensation of activation will be similar to a normal massage.</div>

              You acknowledge that your advertisement may be deleted from the Relief Hub Site if we believe these Terms and Conditions, including our Posting Rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly.
              <br></br>
              You would have already paid a fee for the display of such an ad, so you may be entitled to a refund of such fee. However, we reserve the right not to refund Relief Hub users for any fees paid through the use of our Site if you breach, in our opinion, these Terms and Conditions, which include, without limitation, the Posting Rules.


              <div className="fs-18-700-lato txt-color-darkgray mt-3 mb-1">Amending Your Advertisement</div>
              You can update or amend your contact details at any time by using your My Account page, which can be located on Relief Hub. (Please note: You must be logged in to change your details).
              <br></br>
              If, while verifying your ad, we find a minor infringement of the Terms or Posting Rules, we reserve the right to amend your ad so it meets all Rules and Terms.


              <div className="fs-18-700-lato txt-color-darkgray mt-3 mb-1"> Posting rules</div>
              Your Massage Services ad must not offer sensual, tantra, erotic, or sexual services.
              <br></br>
              If you choose to include an image in your ad, it must be of you, your staff, or your spa, not an image of someone else. All photos must be decent. Ads that contain images of full nudity and sexual or suggestive positions will not be posted, and no refund will be given.
              <br></br>
              You must not use the details (name, phone number, mailing address, email, photos, etc.) of someone else without their permission or provide false contact details.
              <br></br>
              You are solely responsible for all information that you submit to Relief Hub and any consequences that may result from your post. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to refuse or delete content that we believe is inappropriate or breaches the above terms. We also reserve the right, at our discretion, to restrict a user&apos;s usage of Relief Hub either temporarily or permanently, or refuse a user&apos;s registration.

              <div className="fs-18-700-lato txt-color-darkgray mt-3 mb-1">   Refund Policy</div>
              Please note that all payments made are final and non refundable. Once a payment has been processed, we are unable to provide refunds under any circumtances.

              <br></br>
              We strongly encourage everyone to carefully review their purchase and ensure all details are accurate before completing the transaction.


              <div className="fs-18-700-lato txt-color-darkgray mt-3 mb-1">  Advertising Guidelines</div>
              Ads must not discriminate based on protected characteristics as defined by the Equality Act 2010:
              <br></br>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 pt-2">
                <li>Only qualified, professional massage services may be advertised.</li>

                <li>All claims in advertisements must be truthful and verifiable.</li>
                <li>Imagery must be decent and non-suggestive, in compliance with UK advertising standards.</li>

              </ol>
            
              <div className="fs-18-700-lato txt-color-darkgray mt-3 mb-1"> Review Guidelines and Submission Policy</div>
              We encourage all reviews to be detailed and respectful. A simple statement like &quot;waste of time&quot; is not enough. Please include specific feedback about your experience, as it helps others make informed decisions. We do not tolerate any rudeness or disrespect in reviews, and all submissions must follow our community guidelines. Reviews that fail to meet these standards may be removed.

              <br></br>
              <div className="fs-18-700-lato txt-color-darkgray mt-3 mb-1"> Enforcement and Liability</div>
              We reserve the right to remove any advertisement that, in our reasonable opinion, violates our policies or UK law. Relief Hub does not accept liability for user-generated content or any loss or damage arising from the use of our platform, to the fullest extent permitted by UK law.
              <br></br>
              Nothing in these terms shall limit our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, or for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do.

              In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including, without limitation, any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.
              <br></br>
              Relief Hub is not responsible for what happens between the Site users (therapist, SPA, and Salon) and the service consumer. Whatever is agreed between both parties is strictly between them, and Relief Hub will not be responsible for any damages, claims, or liabilities.
